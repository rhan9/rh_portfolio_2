* Utilized Python and a National Basketball Association(NBA) API Client package "nba_api" to visualize Giannis Antetokounmpo's regular season shot chart since he entered the league(2013).

* Created a python script to clean and extract the necessary shot location data from the API output. Data is shown as a Pandas dataframe.

* Python script can be utilized to show similar regular season output for any
current NBA player.

* Used matplotlib to plot out all of our player's regular season shots since he entered the NBA.
